/// ShapeGrid is a generic shape-based spatial partitioning structure that uses a generic storage of cells which acts as a
/// grid instead of a tree.
///
/// ## Fast queries
/// In theory, ShapeGrid should be faster than a quadtree/r-tree because it has no log costs
/// (calculating the cells around a point is trivial).  
/// However, it only works if the cell size is adapted to the problem, much like how a tree has to
/// be balanced to be efficient.  
///
/// ## Dynamicity
/// ShapeGrid's allows eager removals and position updates, however for big shapes (spanning many cells)
/// this can be expensive, so beware.
///
/// Use this grid for mostly static objects with the occasional removal/position update if needed.
///
/// A SlotMap is used for objects managing, adding a level of indirection between shapes and objects.
/// SlotMap is used because removal doesn't alter handles given to the user, while still having constant time access.
/// However it requires O to be copy, but SlotMap's author stated that they were working on a similar
/// map where Copy isn't required.
///
/// ## About object managment
///
/// In theory, you don't have to use the object managment directly, you can make your custom
/// Handle -> Object map by specifying "`()`" to be the object type.
/// _(This can be useful if your object is not Copy)_
/// Since `()` is zero sized, it should probably optimize away a lot of the object managment code.
///
/// ```rust
/// use flat_spatial::ShapeGrid;
/// use geom::Circle;
///
/// let mut g: ShapeGrid<(), Circle> = ShapeGrid::new(10);
/// let handle = g.insert(Circle {
///     center: [0.0, 0.0].into(),
///     radius: 3.0,
/// }, ());
/// // Use handle however you want
/// ```
